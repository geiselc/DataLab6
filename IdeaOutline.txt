1. Server starts and wait
2. Client starts
3. Client send packet to server telling it what file it wants
4. Server tries to find file
5. If file is not found, sends failure packet back
6. If file is found
	e) set up our sending window (set to lowest ack+1)
	f) send 5 packets at a time (first byte is packet number)
		1) keep track of outstanding packets (with an arraylist)
		2) keep track of lowest acked packet (with an int)
	g) client will send an ack when for every new packet they get
	h) client will have an arraylist of bytes arrays that it files with the data
	i) once all packets have been received, it will use this byte array to write the file
	j) if server ever timeouts, re-send as many packets as possible
