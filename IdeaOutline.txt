1. Server starts and wait
2. Client starts
3. Client send packet to server telling it what file it wants
4. Server tries to find file
5. If file is not found, sends failure packet back
6. If file is found
	a) set up our sending window (set to lowest ack+1)
	b) send 5 packets at a time (first byte is packet number)
		1) keep track of outstanding packets (with an arraylist)
		2) keep track of lowest acked packet (with an int)
	c) client will send an ack when for every new packet they get
	d) client will have an hashmap of bytes arrays that it files with data
	e) once all packets have been received, it will use these byte array to write the file
	f) i am not entirely sure how to handle timeouts (on client and server)
		1) i think for timeouts on the client side they shouldn't matter (acks get lost -> packet gets resent)
		2) for the server, im not sure
	g) also we need to think of some way for the client to know that the server is done sending packets
	h) there will probably also be other problems that we are not thinking about
